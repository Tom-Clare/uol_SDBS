A database for a parcel delivery company - University of Lincoln: Scalable Database Systems

The assignment task was as follows:

"A parcel delivery company wishes to build a system to track its vehicles and drivers throughout
the working day, i.e. from 8.00 am to 4:00 pm. The company has fitted each of its vehicles with a
GPS tracking device which will send the data to a database hosted on a cloud system.

You are required to design and implement a MySQL database schema to be used to store
relevant data from these GPS devices. At the start of any dayâ€™s work drivers use whatever
vehicle is assigned to them by the company. Drivers work on shift basis so a morning shift is
from 8:00 am to 11:55 am and an afternoon shift is from 12:00 noon to 4:00 pm."
